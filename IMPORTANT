    muhstik's mechanism to do MODEs and KICKs is terrible.
  It doesn't track any list of nicks to op, or nicks to kick,
  but it tries to change with simple MODE +o and KICK.

    We are just weary of coding something which has a better
  alternative (http://www.sirklabs.hu/ana/), so..  If you
  would like to recode this part of muhstik (with penalty
  handling), and get more experience, you are welcome.

    muhstik needs your help!  Thanks.

  =========================

  muhstik's Makefile requires GNU Make, which is not part of NetBSD.
  You have to install it if you don't have gmake - from pkgsrc, or
  from a precompiled package (devel/gmake).

  After gmake muhstik needs pthread too, that is available in pkgsrc
  also (devel/pth).

  If you have any problem with the NetBSD port, contact roadr.

The muhstik FAQ
---------------

Q: I have no clone online !
A: In a first time, uncomment only one type of connection (gate/socks/proxy...)
   because if on one the server quota is upper than the host list length,
   muhstik will loop until it fulls the server and it will never pass to
   another type of connection.

   Then check the debug mode is enabled and bg is disabled in the init file.

   For each clone, you should see in order :
        1) <type> launched ...
        2) <type> connect()ed nick= ...
        3) clone available nick =...

   If you don't see any of this messages, check the format of your server
   list. If you only see the first, check the format of your
   gate/socks/proxy/vhost list. If it is ok, that is that they are down or
   don't allow anonymous connections, so scan for others.
   If you only see the 1 and the 2, this is a restriction of the IRC server.
   Try other servers and IRC networks.

Q: I can't DCC Chat any clone !
A: By sending a DCC Chat request to a clone, you start a server on an IP
   choosen by your IRC client and send the IP and the port to muhstik. Then it
   has only to connect() on your server. Perhaps it fails because you are
   behind a proxy, or using AOL.

Q: I am using vhosts and the ident of my clones is the same for all so they are
   killed. Please make it change !
A: Muhstik can't change your ident if it is not prefixed by a ~. In this case,
   an ident daemon (identd) is running on your box and authenticates your IRC
   connections. If you are root, you can disable the identd but many servers
   require an ident running to connect you to IRC. So try to configure the
   daemon to change the ident at each connection.

Q: Each time I launch muhstik, I get "You must supply a way of connection."
   What does it mean ?
A: This is widely explained in the text file named README (RTFM).
